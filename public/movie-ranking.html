<h1>POV: Most Interesting Movies </h1>
<h2>Here's a list of top 3 movies</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Tourist Family</h3>
<p> It's a family entertainer.<br/> I would give 10 on 5 stars.<br/>
    It teaches us many life lessons along with bits of humours in every nook and corner.<br/></p>
<h3>Dragon</h3>
<p>2k kids favourite movie.<br/>It's a mix of emotions,sentiments and moral values.<br/>
    Each and every character has played their role perfectly.<br/></p>
<h3>Lubber Pandhu</h3>
<p>As the name suggests its script is based upon
     cricket-not in an international
     level rather events conducted within different areas within a district.<br/>
     Deals with how the hero balances his life and cricket.</p>
